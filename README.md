# Product View Pricing Shipping

This component renders images of the searched or selected item, the pricing of individual items, and a form for users to input thier zip code to get shipping to their city. Users can click on the select an image from the sidebar to see a different view of item and can hover over the item enlarge the photo. 

Here is a list of things that I did with this component:
* Collaborated with four other software engineers in a remote, Agile environment, making use of a Trello board to track tickets and tasks
* Created user interface with React and CSS
* Utilized external API to get city by zip code for shipping component
* Built a proxy server and deployed the full stack app to an AWS EC2 instance

### Workflow
Our team managed workflow and responsibilities by utilizing Agile methodology. Trello was used to to keep track of tickets. With <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">git feature branch workflow</a>, our team managed each of our separate components. When it came time to deploy, we each deployed our separate components and built a proxy server which rendered the separate components together, thereby making use of Service Oriented Architecture.
